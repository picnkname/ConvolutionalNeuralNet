# ConvolutionalNeuralNet
This repository contains code for implementation of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). We used the same features that we learned on 8X8 patches sampled from images from the STL-10 dataset in linear decoder exercise. The CNN has been trained on reduced STL-10 dataset. This dataset comprises 64X64 images from 4 classes (airplane, car, cat, dog). You can download the dataset from http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Exercise:Convolution_and_Pooling

The entire code has been written in Matlab. For more information refer to above link.
