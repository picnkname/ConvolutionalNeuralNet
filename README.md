# ConvolutionalNeuralNet
This repository contains code  for vectorized and unvectorized implementation of autoencoder. The autoencoder has been trained on MNIST dataset. I implemented the autoencoder exercise provided in http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial. The entire code is written in Matlab.
